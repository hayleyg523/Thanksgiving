    <p class="text">I am so thankful that I have such a loving and caring family where everyone is still present in my life today. They give me the necessary support in order for me to get through everyday life. They are my biggest fans who are always there for me no matter what. They are the people that I will never be afraid to turn to about anythinng and will always be willing to help me no matter what. Everyone in my family has such a special place in my heart and role in my life. Especially today and everyday, I will continue to thank them and always keep telling them how grateful I am for all of them and their love and support they have provided for me over the 16 years of me being in this world. I love them all so much and would do anything for them. Today on this holiday, I thank them for the good times and getting me through the bad ones, making me laugh through times of adversity, and for providing me with immense love and care. My family means the world to me, no matter if they live near or far. </p>
